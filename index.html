    Rushton Star Creations were a popular line of vintage plush toys made from the 1950s-1960s.
    A defining feature of these toys was the use of rubber for the face, often with painted features like delicate eyelashes, catchlights in the eyes, and other expressive features.
    These toys featured a variety of animals and characters--bunnies, cats, lambs, and bears being some of the most popular and valuable plush.
    These toys are now highly sought after by collectors due to their vintage status and unique design elements.
    Rushton collectors often seek out rare or unique Rushton creations with original tags.
    The condition of a Rushton item, including original tags and accessories, significantly impacts its value and desirability. <br>
    <br> The creator of this toy company was Mary Rushton who can be seen sculpting and molding prototype faces for her plush in the images below.
    The company continued to offer a range of products until its closure in approximately 1984, when Mary Rushton passed away.
